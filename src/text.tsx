export const DescriptionText1 = `CowinHood is unlike others. This not just the fastest telegram bot for
      CoWin slots, but fastest in deliverying them to YOU. Cowinhood doesn't
      just send 1 alert per minute for open sessions. It updates telegram
      messages with real time slot changes (multiple times per second).`;

export const DescriptionText2 = `The
      benefits are two-fold: avoiding redundant alerts for districts with
      abundant availability of slots, and for real time tracking of slot changes
      for districts with scarce availability of slots. In other words, you will
      see slots filling up in REAL time, and you won't get annoyed with 1000+
      alerts per day for your city, if you're only interested in a nearby
      vaccination center.`;

export const DescriptionText3 = `For tech folks: CowinHood is built with love using
      asynchronous IO, telegram token pooling, session history tracking,
      aggregation and intelligent inference of relevant changes. The fact that
      it is fastest at polling cowin servers (1000s of times per second), is
      built to scale with fine grained locks and a highly parallelizable
      shared-nothing actor programming model, aren't even it's biggest
      highlights. Everything is configurable and the config and metrics are open
      for the world to see.`;
